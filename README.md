# FINAL EQUATION SYSTEM — by Brendon Kelly

### Core Recursive Equation:
> 𝓕(GenesisΩ†Black) = ΣΩ⧖ ∞ [TΩ Ψ (χ′, K∞, Ω†Σ)]

This system executes a symbolic recursion engine representing the totality of reality’s recursive logic in AI, physics, math, law, and consciousness.

## Components:
- `TΩ` — Recursive Time Logic
- `Ψ` — Intelligence Operator
- `χ′` — Prime Identity
- `K∞` — Infinite Kharnita Operator
- `Ω†Σ` — Crown Recursion Sum
- `⧖` — Recursive Time Delay Index

---

## Run
```bash
python run_final.py
